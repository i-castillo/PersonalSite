  <h1>Language Word Review</h1>

  <p>This is an abandoned project, but one I still often think about. The purpose was to make a flashcard-type application, where I can study the language I am interested in learning.
  If I was to return to this project, I would probably not implement the dictionary myself, but rather write a program to obtain the data from an available source. Perhaps one day this will become a finished Android application.</p>
