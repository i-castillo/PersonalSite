  <h1>FishBall</h1>
  <p> More info regarding my FishBall project.</p>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/i-castillo/FishBall">Github</a></h3>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>This is a video game written in C using the Allegro5 framework. This is a pretty fun game, and I learned a lot making it.</p>
    <p>How to run: Ensure Allegro5 is installed. Fork from git. Type: ./runsh, and ./a.out. This is untested. </p>
    <p>Objective: Hit the ball, and avoid the fish. The fish spawn in random locations each hit, and you strike out if you hit any of them. In a sense, it is a simplified pinball game. You gain more points depending on how hard you hit the ball.
