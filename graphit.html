  <h1>Graphit</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this page is to walk through some of the capabilities, and background of my Graphit project.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/i-castillo/NGraphit">Github</a></h3>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>This project was written in the Computer Science lab at UCSD. It was written with a friend, and then rewritten due to more knowledge,
    and the lack of extensibilty available with the first iteration. Initially, it was written in Winter 2017, and finished shortly after the winter quarter began. In June of 2017, I decicided
    to return to the project because of some glaring issues. First, the way the project interpreted a string of text was bizarre. It also couldn't graph combinations of functions. </p>
  <p>It was written in Java, because thats all we knew at the time. We wanted to write it using JavaFX, but the public computers didn't have that installed at the time, so we wrote it using the Swing library.
